# Trinity denovo S.pirogyra assembly

Kohn Clay, Trey Belew, Najib El-Sayed, Caren Chang.

This assembly is based on the RNA-seq data described in Van de Poel et
al. “Transcriptome profiling of the green alga Spirogyra pratensis (Charophyta)
suggests an ancestral role for ethylene in cell wall metabolism, photosynthesis,
and abiotic stress responses.” Plant Physiology (2016) 172, 533-545
(doi:10.1104/pp.16.00299). The raw sequence reads used for this assembly can be
found under SRA accession SRP081241, and also under BioProject accession
PRJNA335946  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA335946). 

A prior transcriptome shotgun assembly for the same reads can be found at
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1248843909 (TSA accession GFWN00000000.1).
